These case files can replicate the kinematics of kinsey and dumas. 

1) Compile the code in the twoDoscillatingDisplacement.

2) Execute the ./run.sh file in the snappy_tutorial/ directory.

3) Once the mesh is generated go to pitch_plunge_custom/ directoryand execute the ./run.sh file there.

4) To check mesh motion and quality go to DyM_custom and run the ./moveMesh.sh script. This will save time because it only solves for the mesh

The ./cleanCase.sh can be run to clean a directory.
