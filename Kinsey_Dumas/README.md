These case files can replicate the kinematics of kinsey and dumas. Compile the code in the twoDoscillatingDisplacement.
Later execute the ./run.sh file in the snappy_tutorial/ directory. Once the mesh is generated go to pitch_plunge_custom directory
and execute the ./run.sh file there.

The ./cleanCase.sh can be run to clean a directory.
