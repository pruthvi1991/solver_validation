These case files can replicate the kinematics of kinsey and dumas. 

1) Compile the code in the twoDoscillatingDisplacement.

2) Execute the ./run.sh file in the snappy_tutorial/ directory.

3) Once the mesh is generated go to pitch_plunge_custom directoryand execute the ./run.sh file there.

The ./cleanCase.sh can be run to clean a directory.
